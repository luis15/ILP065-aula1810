# API Consuming with Axios

## Using the VueJs

As the example of the original repo of @luis15, I've made the exactly example using VueJs. This was for study purposes on:

- API Usage and Consuming;
- VueJs Rendering;
- Refactoring the code to be more readable via VueJs.

## How to test it?

Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/GabrielCoelho/ILP065-aula1810.git
```

Enter into the folder

```
cd ILP065-aula1810
```

Run the `npm` commands and go to your preference browser to see it working

```
npm install && npm run dev
```
